A solution to a problem about a biased random walk

* phinum.py defines PhiNum, the type of numbers in the field Q[phi], along with phi and sqrt5
* walk.py defines p(n) which is the probability of ending at -1 rather than 0
  l(n) which is the expected length of a walk starting at n,
  along with approx_{p,l} which give p and l calculated as floating point numbers rather than exactly
